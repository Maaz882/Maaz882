## 👨‍💻 About Me

* 🔭 Currently finishing my B.Tech (Specialization: Artificial Intelligence) at **Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi**.
* 🎯 I enjoy building practical ML systems (computer vision, reinforcement learning) and full-stack prototypes that make research usable.
* 💡 My strengths: problem solving, clean code, rapid prototyping, and shipping reproducible experiments.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### Deep-Check-Net (Self‑play Chess Engine)

* Trained a deep Residual CNN with separate policy & value heads using self-play reinforcement learning.
* Integrated Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Dirichlet noise for exploration.
* Provides both CLI and Pygame GUI for Human vs AI and AI vs AI play.

### AI‑Powered Virtual Mouse

* Real-time hand-tracking based virtual mouse using **MediaPipe** + **OpenCV**.
* Gesture mapping for click, scroll, drag; optimized for low-latency control.

### Lung Disease Detection (X‑ray Classification)

* Fine-tuned **InceptionV3** to classify chest X-rays into: Bacterial Pneumonia, COVID-19, Normal, Tuberculosis, Viral Pneumonia.
* Built a GUI for image upload and live predictions; handled class imbalance and augmentation.

### Image Segmentation (U‑Net)

* Trained a U‑Net on CARLA simulator data with batch norm + dropout. Achieved strong train/val performance for segmentation tasks.
